# Brasilino
Project of RC Car controlled by RaspberryPi via WiFi.

It will use Java client to receive commands via Socket from Mobile Remote control and Android controller that will commands the car and receive streaming from Car's camera.

The name means a mix between Brasilia (very popular old brazilian car) and Arduino.

It's developed by Jeff Prestes (@jeffprestes) and #Things Hacker Team# (Ricardo Ogliari, Matheus Marabesi, Fernando Veiga, Pedro Padilha, Ryoji Kuwae Neto).

PS.: Arduino was removed as we figure out L298N board that controls motors with Digital output so Arduino is not needed.
